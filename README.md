# STM32-BlackPill-FanPumpController
## Introduction
 This Project is about building a Controller for PWM-Fans and Pumps with a Display and Mounting-Bracket. It utilizes a STM32-BlackPill-Board (stm32f103c8), which is programmed with STM32duino.

## 1. Planning and Breadboard-Mockup
The Controller needs to do 3 different Tasks:
 - Controll at least 2 PWM-Fans/Pumps
 - Read the Temperature from a Watercooling Temperature-Sensor
 - Display the Information on a little Display
 The chosen Microcontroller is an stm32f103c8, because it is very inexpensive and has more than enough performance for this application.
